                    Hello, and welcome to my interactive Resume!
                </p>
                <div class="About_Me">
                <p>
                    A little about me, I started in customer service during my senior year of High School through a retail sales class. As part of the program, I was an Intern at Long's Drugs, TJ Maxx, and Mervyn's. After graduating, I went back to Mervyn's as an employee until they closed down. Trying to continue in the same line of work, I eventually branched into fast food during my early twenties. Once I had a good amount of experience in a face to face customer service role, I found myself at a call center for Boost Mobile and quickly moved up the chain into their tech support division and immediately felt like I had found my calling. However, due to a lack of growth opportunities, I left and Started working as a security guard for a few years with a couple different companies.

                    During my jobs as a security guard, I was often at construction sites and saw various aspects of the different industries. After doing some research and brushing up on my math skills, I joined the local 460 for plumbers and pipefitters. I enjoyed working with my hands outdoors and learning new skills in the trade, as well as gaining knowledge in the weekly classes they provided. As the Oil and gas industry slowed down, I decided to try my hand at the electrical trade, and became a solar construction worker through the IBEW. The work was well paid, but very repetitive and always located far from home.

                    During my time in Solar, I remembered time spent working in customer service and tech support. I started researching IT roles and working towards certifications to potentially get an entry level position. After going through several online courses, I was able to obtain my A+ certification and am currently working towards Network+. I've also taken several web design and coding courses, covering topics such as HTML and CSS, Python, C++, javascript, and SQL. These courses have taught me a lot, and confirmed my interest in the field of IT.
