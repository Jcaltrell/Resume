                    Whether it was at home, in school, or during employment, I have gained several skills to ensure that I remain an asset to any team that I'm a part of. They vary across different industries, but most can be applied to all.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Microsft 365: I have been using the Microsoft Suite of apps since early childhood. Examples include writing reports in Word, learning Excel at school and later using it to keep track of finances, Using Frontpage during my Web Design classes in high school, creating powerpoint presentations for assignments, and many other cases both professional and personal.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                     Troubleshooting Windows/Mac OS: Throughout my life, anyone having issues with something computer related would ask me for help. I've built PC's for my friends and family, assisted cowokers with setting up their emails, removed viruses/malware from their computers and laptops, suggested products to fit their needs, and solved any issues on my own PC as well. Other tasks that people have asked me to help with include setting up speakers and cameras, transferring files to mobile devices, and installing games and game mods.  
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    PC Repair: Anytime a computer component failed, I was able to swap it out with a new one. I have repaired faulty laptop screens, reformatted drives after recovering any data possible, upgraded operating systems, created system images and restore points, upgraded components, and more. 
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>ClickUP: After learning that Jira is a commonly used project management software in IT, I downloaded a free trial and learned as much as I could before switching to ClickUp. In my opinion, they are extremely similar and I found both very easy to use. I still use ClickUp for tracking my personal projects.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Data Entry: During various employment, I would be tasked with submitting documents with large amounts of information, and comparing it to previous data. I also learned this skill through my SQL course, as well as in game modding.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Attention to detail: Every job I've held has required attention to detail for different reasons. In customer service, personal preferences or information needed to be known and applied to orders. Product knowledge was also very useful for this purpose. In security, hourly reports had to be detailed and informative for higher ups to have a firm understanding of any issues or concerns of the property and the people there. In the oilfields, careless mistakes could cause injury or worse. So details were very important to take note of in all work processes. And in solar farms, attention to detail was required to ensure that everything was clean, and wires were arranged in a manner that would not cause them to become damaged by moving parts or weather.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Communication: Effective communication can make or break any situation. It is important to ensure that those you are speaking with or writing to can easily understand what it is that you're saying, and why. I believe this is one of the most important skills to have in order to be successful in an endeavor.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                    Customer Service: Starting my senior year of high school, I had the opportunity toexperience customer interaction as part of a company. I learned to assess a customer'swants/needs, and make recommendations based on them. De-escalation skills were especially important in ensuring a good experience for customers, and providing thecompany with a positive image.
                </li>
                </ul>

            Currently my only certification is CompTIA A+. However, I am eagerly working towards my Network+ and MCSE certifications.
